numchk
======

The numchk tool is a command-line tool that identifies self-consistent
numbers and checks their correctness.  In short, it is like `file(1)`
for numbers.

The focus is on fast bulk processing of identifiers arising primarily in
the financial sector.  The design, inspired by [libarchive][1], allows for
easy extension.
